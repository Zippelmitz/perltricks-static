My typing is horrible. I make mistakes all the time. I'm an avid [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) user but I still use the arrow keys. I'm one of those people who need technology that does what they meant, not what they asked for. So if you're a coder like me, you probably see this a lot:

``` prettyprint
$ git push origin amster
error: src refspec amster does not match any.
```

Fortunately there is a simple workaround: Git's [symbolic references](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-symbolic-ref). I can add a symbolic reference for `amster`:

``` prettyprint
$ git symbolic-ref refs/heads/amster refs/heads/master
```

And now Git does what I meant:

``` prettyprint
$ git push origin amster
Counting objects: 3, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 695 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@github.com:user/SomeProject.git
   ec208c7..fb0cb8f  amster -> master
```

Because it's a symbolic reference, anytime I mean to type `master` but actually type `amster`, Git will do the right thing. Try it!
