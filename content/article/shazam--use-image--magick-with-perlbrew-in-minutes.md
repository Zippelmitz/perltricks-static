   "description" : "How to get a local non-root install of Image::Magick working with Perlbrew"
}

*The open source ImageMagick software provides amazing tools for creating and manipulating images in over 100 formats. Unfortunately, installing ImageMagick's Perl module under Perlbrew can be a frustrating and time-consuming task. However it doesn't have to be this way - with the method described below you can have the module installed in minutes, no root access required!*

### *Update 07-01-2014*

Zaki ([@zhmughal](https://twitter.com/zmughal)) has worked up a sweet [shell script](https://gist.github.com/zmughal/8264712/raw/8831e421393143c5b48f22dcfa12eeda51c5cfbf/install-imagemagick-perl) to automate the installation process for you, so you can save the finger work for using ImageMagick with your next Perl program:)

### Requirements

You'll need to have Perlbrew and a local Perl installation via Perlbrew on Unix-based platform. This has been tested on Perl 5.16.3 but should work on any modern Perl version.

### Preparation

Create a local directory: we will install ImageMagick here. Open up the terminal and enter the following:

``` prettyprint
mkdir ~/local
```

### Installing Image::Magick - don't use CPAN

Although the [Image::Magick](https://metacpan.org/pod/Image::Magick) module is available on CPAN, installing it via CPAN is usually a fruitless task as the process croaks on make. Instead download the whole [ImageMagick tarball](http://www.imagemagick.org/download/ImageMagick.tar.gz). Once downloaded, navigate to the tarball's parent directory using the terminal and un-tar the archive with the following command

``` prettyprint
tar xvfz ImageMagick.tar.gz
```

Now change into the new directory:

``` prettyprint
cd ImageMagick-6.8.8-0
```

Enter the following command, replacing [username], [path to CORE] and [path to Perl bin] with your system's details. Remove the "--without-threads" text if your Perl was compiled with threads (here is how to check).

``` prettyprint
LDFLAGS=-L/home/[username]/perl5/perlbrew/perls/[path to CORE] \
    ./configure --prefix /home/[username]/local \
    --with-perl=/home/[username]/perl5/perlbrew/perls/[path to Perl bin] \
    --enable-shared --without-threads
```

Here is a completed example for my system:

``` prettyprint
LDFLAGS=-L/home/sillymoose/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.16.3/lib/5.16.3/x86_64-linux/CORE \
    ./configure --prefix /home/sillymoose/local \
    --with-perl=/home/sillymoose/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.16.3/bin/perl \
    --enable-shared --without-threads
```

Running this command should cause ImageMagick to run a series of configuration checks, at the end of which it will print a configuration summary, which should look something like this:

``` prettyprint
ImageMagick is configured as follows. Please verify that this configuration
matches your expectations.

Host system type: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Build system type: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

ZLIB              --with-zlib=yes       yes
```

Check that the image file formats you expect to be working with are showing as "yes". If any are showing as "no" that you require, you'll need to install the appropriate C library (e.g. libpng for PNG files) and re-run the previous command.

To install ImageMagick and the Image::Magick Perl module, run this command:

``` prettyprint
make install
```

### Confirm Installation

Confirming that the Image::Magick module has installed is not quite straightforward either. With version Image Magick 6.8.8, the $VERSION variable is stored in the super class Image::Magick::Q16. Hence you'll need to type:

``` prettyprint
perl -MImage::Magick::Q16\ 999
```

Which should yield:

``` prettyprint
Image::Magick::Q16 version 999 required--this is only version 6.88.
```
