Welcome to "What's new on CPAN", a curated look at last month's new CPAN uploads for your reading and programming pleasure. Enjoy!

### Module of the month

[Class::Storage](https://metacpan.org/pod/Class::Storage) is a module for serializing blessed references (objects). Once serialized, an object can be transmitted via JSON, XML, YAML or saved in a data store. Serializing objects can also make IPC easier: coroutines, threads and other processes can pass text but blessed references are often an issue.

Module author Peter Valdemar MÃ¸rch has pulled together excellent documentation. A welcome addition to CPAN, check out the acknowledgements [section](https://metacpan.org/pod/Class::Storage#ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS) for some interesting background on the module. For an alternative approach, you might be interested in [Object::Serializer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Object::Serializer). For non-readable serializers, checkout [Storable](https://metacpan.org/pod/Storable) and the newer and faster [Sereal](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sereal).

**Important** - when working with object serializers like Class::Storage, only deserialize trusted data, as malicious code can be injected into the data, and when the data is deserialized, the code will be executed automatically. See for example this bug [report](https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=105772) (*Thanks to Reini Urban for the reminder*).
