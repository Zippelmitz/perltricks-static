*Managing application file uploads is challenging: storage, de-duplication, retrieval and permissions all need to be handled. DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::FS simplifies the challenge by handling the backend storage of files so the programmer can focus on application development. Let's take a closer look at how it works.*

### Requirements

To use this example, you'll need to install [DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::FS](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::FS) from CPAN. The CPAN Testers [results](http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=DBIx-Class-InflateColumn-FS+0.01007) show that it should run on all platforms, including Windows. You'll also need [DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader) and [File::MimeInfo](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::MimeInfo) if you don't already have them and [SQLite3](https://sqlite.org/). To install the Perl modules, open the terminal and enter:

``` prettyprint
$ cpan DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::FS DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader File::MimeInfo
```

### Setup the result class

Let's create an example class for handling file uploads. DBIx::Class maps objects to database tables, so we need to create a database table that represents our file upload object. This is the SQL code for creating the upload table:

``` prettyprint
create table upload (
    id          integer     primary key,
    file        text        not null,
    mime        text        not null
);
```

Save the code into a script called create\_upload.sql and run it at the command line:

``` prettyprint
$ sqlite3 MyApp.db < create_upload.sql
```

This will create the upload table. Next we can use the "dbicdump" app that comes with DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader to create the basic result class for us:

``` prettyprint
$ dbicdump MyApp::Schema dbi:SQLite:MyApp.db
```

Open up the newly-created MyApp/Schema/Result/Upload.pm in a text editor and add the following code, below the line beginning "\# DO NOT MODIFY ...":

``` prettyprint
use File::MimeInfo 'extensions';

__PACKAGE__->load_components("InflateColumn::FS");
__PACKAGE__->add_columns(
    "file",
    {   
        data_type      => 'TEXT',
        is_fs_column   => 1,
        fs_column_path => 'uploads',
    }   
);

sub extension { 
    my ($self) = @_;
    [ extensions($self->mime) ]->[0];
}
```

This code enables the DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::FS plugin on the "file" attribute of our Upload class. Additionally we've added a subroutine called "extension" that will return the file extension for the file.

### Create an upload

This script will create an upload object:

``` prettyprint
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use MyApp::Schema;
use MIME::Types;
use lib '.';

open(my $file, '<', $ARGV[0]) or die $!; 

my $schema = MyApp::Schema->connect('dbi:SQLite:MyApp.db');

# Add the file to the database and file system
my $upload = $schema->resultset('Upload')->
        create({ file => $file,
                 mime => (MIME::Types->new->mimeTypeOf($ARGV[0])) });
```

Saving the script as "create\_upload.pl" we can call it at the terminal, passing the filepath to the file we want to save:

``` prettyprint
$ perl create_upload.pl perltricks_logo.png
```

Just by creating the object, DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::FS will save the file in our uploads directory. No need to write extra code that explicitly copies the file.

### Retrieve an upload

This script will retrieve the upload object. DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::FS automatically inflates the "file" column to be a [Path::Class::File](https://metacpan.org/pod/Path::Class::File) object, which gives us many convenience methods:

``` prettyprint
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use MyApp::Schema;
use lib '.';

my $schema = MyApp::Schema->connect('dbi:SQLite:MyApp.db');

# retrieve the upload
my $upload = $schema->resultset('Upload')->find(1);

# get the relative path
$upload->file->relative;

# get the absolute path
$upload->file->absolute;

# get the base filename
$upload->file->basename;

# get the mime type (image/png)
$upload->mime;

# get the file extension
$upload->extension;

# get a read filehandle
$upload->file->openr;

# get a write filehandle
$upload->file->openw;

# get an append filehandle
$upload->file->opena;
```

### Delete an upload

DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::FS makes it super-simple to delete files. Simply call delete on the result object to delete it from the table and the file system:

``` prettyprint
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use MyApp::Schema;
use lib '.';

my $schema = MyApp::Schema->connect('dbi:SQLite:MyApp.db');

# retrieve the upload
my $upload = $schema->resultset('Upload')->find(1);

# delete the file from the database and file system
$upload->delete;
```

### Conclusion

DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::FS is useful as-is, but it shines in certain situations. For example if you're managing image files, it really pays to store the original high-quality image, and dynamically re-size the image when requested. This way you minimize disk use and retain the flexibility in the application logic to adjust the images as required.
