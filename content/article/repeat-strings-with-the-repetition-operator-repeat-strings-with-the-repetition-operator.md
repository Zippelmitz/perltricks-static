You get the idea - Perl has a repetition operator (x) that repeats the scalar or list on its left by the number on it's right (like multiplication).

``` prettyprint
my $string = 'I like chocolate';
print $string x 10;
#results

I like chocolateI like chocolateI like chocolateI like chocolateI like chocolateI like chocolateI like chocolateI like chocolateI like chocolateI like chocolate
```

You may be able to think of more useful employment for this operator, like this:

``` prettyprint
perl -CS -e 'print qq!\N{U+2661} \N{U+2665}! x 1000;'
```
