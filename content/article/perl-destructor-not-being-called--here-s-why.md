If you're using a Perl destructor method ('DESTROY', 'DEMOLISH') it may not be called if the Perl process is terminated abruptly by a signal. To fix this, just add the sigtrap pragma to your program:

``` prettyprint
use sigtrap qw/die normal-signals/;
```

Now if the program receives a SIGINT or SIGTERM, the Perl process will die and call the destructor.
