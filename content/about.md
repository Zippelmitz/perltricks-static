## About Us

PerlTricks.com was launched in March 2013 with the goal of producing well-written, timely Perl programming articles. Our articles cover different aspects of Perl relating to coding, culture and community.

### Write for us
Do you have a favorite Perl trick or module that the World needs to know about? Perhaps you want to promote a new app or share community news. Our articles are written in markdown and hosted on our GitHub repo. Check out the repo readme for contributing guidelines.

### Contact
We love to hear from our readers. If you have any comments, tips, article ideas or anything else to tell us, please email the editor: editor@perltricks.com.
